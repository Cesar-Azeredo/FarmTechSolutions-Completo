## 📂 Project Structure

### 🌱 Phase 1 – Crop Management and Data Analysis

#### 📘 Introduction

In this first phase, the **FarmTech Solutions** team developed an application in **Python** to support farms transitioning to **Digital Agriculture**, aiming to increase productivity and input control.

#### 🧩 Main Features

- **Support for 2 types of agricultural crops** chosen by the team
- **Planting area calculation** with different geometric shapes (rectangle, trapezoid, circle)
- **Input management calculation** (fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides) considering area and applied quantity
- **Data structures with vectors** to store and manipulate crop information
- **Interactive menu** with operations:
  - Data entry
  - Data output (terminal reports)
  - Update and delete records
  - Application termination option
- **Use of loops and conditional structures** for logical flow and calculation repetition

#### 🧮 Integration with R

After data collection and calculation, an application in **R** performs statistical analyses:

- Means, standard deviations, and dispersion
- Graphical visualizations
- Optional integration with public weather API ([Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com)) for climate analysis

#### 🌦️ Going Beyond

Using **R**, it's possible to connect to weather APIs to collect climate data and display information directly in the terminal, integrating agricultural and environmental data.

### 🤖 Phase 2 – IoT and Integrated Systems

#### 📘 Introduction

**Phase 2** advances to the practical application of digital agriculture, focusing on **IoT and agricultural automation**. The team developed a **smart irrigation system** capable of monitoring soil variables and automatically deciding when to irrigate.

#### ⚙️ Wokwi Simulation (`Fase2/SimulacaoWokwi/`)

Based on agricultural environment simulation, the following sensors and actuators were implemented:

- **Buttons (3)** representing **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, and **Potassium (K)** sensors
- **LDR Sensor (Light Dependent Resistor)** simulating **soil pH**, ranging from 0 to 14
- **DHT22 Sensor** representing **soil moisture** (replacing the actual moisture sensor)
- **Blue Relay** representing a real **irrigation pump**, automatically controlled

#### 💧 Irrigation Logic

The system monitors in real-time the levels of N, P, K, pH, and moisture. Based on this data, the ESP32 decides whether irrigation should be activated, simulating the actual operation of a digital farm. The irrigation logic varies according to the agricultural crop chosen.

#### 🌐 Going Beyond – Integration with Python and R

- **Integration with weather API ([OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org)):** allows rain prediction and automatic irrigation adjustment
- **Reading via Serial Monitor:** allows manual data input in the Wokwi simulator during execution
- **Statistical analysis in R:** the system can use R to decide when to activate the irrigation pump based on climate and nutritional variables

This stage promotes integration between **sensing, IoT, Data Science, and agricultural automation**, reinforcing the concept of **smart farming**.
